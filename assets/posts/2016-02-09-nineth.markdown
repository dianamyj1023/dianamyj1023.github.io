Despite the excellent classification performance, recent research has revealed that the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) could be readily deceived by only the small adversarial perturbation.
Its imperceptible to human eyes and transferability from one model to another actually threaten the security
of a CNN-based system. This project aims to build a robust CNN structure that has stable performance against the external disturbances during image classification task.
