The purpose of this project is to enhance the eciency and safety of human-robot collaboration while assembling a product. 
I am focusing on making the robot learn to allocate its own task based on its capability and human's intention. 
Human's intention and each agents' capabilities are are usually not fully observable and may change during the process. 
Fully understanding tehse factors and assigning tasks accordingly will greatly enhance the task performance.
