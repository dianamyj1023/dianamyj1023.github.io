Many tasks such as object detection and pattern recognition can be performed at levels surpassing that of humans thanks to the recent developments in deep neural
networks. However, all sensors still have limited sensing capabilities which can result in serious car accidents due to the unobservable risk. Humans, on the other hand, have great
insights to handle unobservable situations, and many researchers have attempted to adapt these human-like behaviors. This work aims to incorporate interaction between
road users to deal with decision-making under occlusion cases during urban driving.
