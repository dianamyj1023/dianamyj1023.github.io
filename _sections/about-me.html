<p> I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 
    My advisor is Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell, I am doing research in Human-Centered Autonomy Laboratory (HCAL). 
    Prior to UIUC, I recieved my B.S. in Electronics Engineering at Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea in 2018.
    My research interest is in human-robot interaction and robust learning-based decision-making. </p>
